					<h3>A Presetnation on Starting with Puppet for Dev-types</h3>

					<h2>Purpose of this Presentation</h2>
					<p>This presentation is designed to highlight some of the similarites and differences for those approaching puppet from the background of someone familiar with C++ like languages (C++, Java, C#, all that jazz). It's not intended to teach Puppet, but to highlight areas where myself and others have mentioned there being painpoints, or things it's important to bear in mind. It's quite wordy, as it's intended to be read and used as a reference.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>Puppet Recap</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Configuration utility</li>
							<li><a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_summary.html">Uses its own domain specifc language</a> - Ruby influenced, but defs not Ruby<sup><small>[1]</small></sup></li>
							<li>Puppet is declarative - you tell it the  end state you want, rather than the steps you want to take</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><small>1. Puppet used to have a Ruby based dsl, but <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/blog/ruby-dsl">it has been removed</a></small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Terms and Language Used</h2>
						<p>Puppet uses many shared terms with C++ like languages, but the meanings can differ. There will of course be new Puppet specific terms also.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Resource</h2>
						<p>A Resource is unit of configuration within puppet. Coniguration in Puppet boils down to a number of resources being applied. Each resource is of a specific resource type, much like the class instance relationship in C++ like languages. So just as I can have a File class, and create many instances of it, Puppet has a file resource type which can be applied via many file resources.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Class</h2>
						<p>Class: a named block of puppet code. Typically used to handle medium to large groups of configuration. A class can be made up by a number of resources, but may also entail other logic. For example, class may have conditional logic to assess if a resouce should be used or not.</p>
						<p>Importantly, classes are singletons: a class can be applied once per compilation. You can apply the class differently between copmilations, but applying the same class twice (even with the same arguments) in a single compilation is not allowed.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Define</h2>
						<p>Defining a resource type or a class in puppet means specifying how it works. Defining a resource or class means that it can be used, but you need to declare it to actually use it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Declare</h2>
						<p>To declare something in puppet means to add it to the configuration. So if I declare a resource, when puppet goes and applies my config it will include the config specified by that resource.</p>
						<p>Note that declaring something doesn't impose an ordering on when it's applied. If I declare foo before bar, that doesn't mean the foo resource will be applied by puppet before bar. More on this later.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Manifest</h2>
						<p>A manifest is a file containing puppet code. They have the extension .pp.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Module</h2>
						<p>A module is a collection of puppet classes. A module may also contain additional content, such as: static files used by its classes, tests, examples, and templates.</p>
						<p>There are a number of rules on how modules should be structured, though there is some flexibility within said rules.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Node</h2>
						<p>A node refers to an instance being conifured with puppet. This results in a number of node related terms:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Node agent: the puppet client responsible for reading information from and configuring nodes. Sometimes just 'agent' or 'node'.</li>
							<li>Node definition: a deinition specific to one or more nodes. The main manifest may specify different deinitions for the nodes it's confifuring</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Term: Catalog</h2>
						<p>A catalog is a document describing the desired state of each resource, and as such the desired state of a node. A catalog is the result of evaluating a number of logical steps, including applying the manifest specified for some node.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Idempotence</h2>
					<p>An important concept of puppet is that applying manifests should be idempotent: applying them multiple times has the same result. This fits into the idea that these manifests describe the desired state, not a number of steps to reach that state.</p>
					<p>Puppet has a resource, <b>exec</b>, which runs a command. Be careful when using this, as well as your own cutom resources, to make sure the result is idempotent.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Design: Classes, Modules, and Beyond</h2>
						<p>A lot of concepts from general purpose programming can be applied in the context of design in puppet!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Focused Purpose</h2>
						<p>Puppet modules and classes should focus on their purpose. The purpose of a module is typically the installation, setup, and configuration of some program or tool. The classes within that module then hangle specifc parts of that process</p>
						<p>If a module or class is starting to sprawl beyong its intended purpose it can be split into another! This helps keep things focuses, hopefully understandable, and encourages reuse of code</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>
						<p>If you find yourself repeating code it's possible you want to abstract that code to a format that can easily be reused! Breaking the code out and reusing it as a module, class, function, or resource saves on repeating yourself, makes code easier to understand, and also makes you look cool.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Reivent the Wheel: Nah</h2>
						<p>There's a wealth of puppet modules available to use: the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/">puppet forge</a> has lots, there's maybe work from your particular organisation, and there's the web at large!</p>
						<p>If you want to undertake a project, see if someone has already created something that can help you out. While it's cool to make new things, it's also cool to save time be using pre-existing code!</p>
					</section>

						<h2>Ordering In Puppet</h2>
						<p>Imposing order on what you're doing with puppet can get pretty involved. There are a number of different ways to do so, some implicit rules, and some gotchas to be aware of.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Somtimes You Won't Need Ordering</h2>
						<p>While we may think of doing tasks as occurring in a certain order, they may not need to be order as such. For example, if I'm creating 3 files, I'll think about doing them one after another, but it doesn't really matter to puppet to have that ordering, we can just let it do them in whatever order it decides (or maybe it could do them all at once? Who knows! Doesn't matter to us).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Implicit Ordering</h2>
						<p>Puppet does have some implicit rules about ordering. If you want to explicitly order stuff it's probably best to do so anyway. But here are the implicit rules: by default puppet applies resources in the order they're declared in a manifest (but even this can change). Note this is resources, not classes, which are a whole different ball of way.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Explicit Ordering</h2>
						<p>If you need to explicitly order things there's a <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_relationships.html">few ways to do this</a>:</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Relationship Metaparameters: <b>before</b>, <b>require</b>, <b>notify</b>, <b>subscribe</b> can be used to order resources. The first two order something before or after something else. The latter two do the same, but also refresh the resource if it's dependency is altered.</li>
								<li>Chaining Arrows: Ordering arrows: foo -> bar, applies foo before bar. Notification arrows: foo ~> bar, applies foo before bar and refreshes bar if foo is changed.</li>
								<li>Require Function: <b>require</b> (different from the metaparameter) can be used to include a class and make sure that class is applied before the class requiring it. I.e. if foo requires bar, bar will be applied before foo.
							</ul>
